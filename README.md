# Flood of Code

## Description
Floods account for more than $1 billion in property losses in the United States each year, and everyone is susceptible to flood damage, whether from storms, water main breaks, or sewer backups. In recent years, strong rain storms have been occurring more frequently than expected, and climatologists warn the trend may continue as the effects of climate change increase. 

## Project Purpose
Flooding is part of St. Louis with records of six major floodings since 2008 and two record-setting floods in the last three years alone. Our goal is to help the St. Louis community acessing information about floded streets which will allow them to avoid delays in their daily lives.

## Files Description
Dockerfile - commands needed in order to build a docker container
requirements.txt - modules the main app needs to deploy
app.py - map creation and dash application
